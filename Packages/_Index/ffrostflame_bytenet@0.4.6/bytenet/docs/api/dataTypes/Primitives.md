<h1>Available primitive types</h1>

</div>

ByteNet provides a large amount of "primitive" types for you to build more complex types that suit your game. Since primitive types don't need any parameters, you can just access them like the following: `ByteNet.<typename>`. For building more complex data structures, go look at the <a href="../Specials">Specials page.</a>
